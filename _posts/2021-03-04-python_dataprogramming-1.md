```{.python}
# an example of a dataframe in which python code can be executed in a browser

# variable x is assigned value 10
x = 10

# variable y is assigned value 20
y = 20

# print the result of expressing that x is equal to y (False as x does not equal y)
print(x == y)

# variable 'text' is assigned the string 'x * y ='
text = 'x * y ='

# print the value of variable 'text' followed by the sum of 'x * y', each of which have previously been defined
print(text, (x * y))

# change the value of 'x' by assigning the value 20
x = 20

print(text, (x * y))

# print the result of expressing that x is equal to y (True as x does equal y)
print(x == y)

# print the output of the `print` function
print(print(x== y))
```
